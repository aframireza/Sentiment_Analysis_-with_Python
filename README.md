# Hotel Reviews Preprocessing and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains Python code for preprocessing and sentiment analysis of hotel reviews. It includes data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally, sentiment analysis is performed using multiple algorithms including TextBlob, VADER Sentiment Analyzer, and Hugging Face Transformers Sentiment Analysis Pipeline.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. Removal of URLs from the reviews.
2. Removal of irrelevant characters and punctuation.
3. Conversion of all characters to lowercase.
4. Tokenization of the text.
5. Removal of stopwords.
6. Stemming and lemmatization.
7. Removal of words with length less than or equal to 2.

## Sentiment Analysis Algorithms

Three different sentiment analysis algorithms are utilized:

**TextBlob:** 
A simple, rule-based sentiment analysis library.

**VADER Sentiment Analyzer:** 
A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.

**Hugging Face Transformers Sentiment Analysis Pipeline:** 
A transformer-based model for sentiment analysis.
